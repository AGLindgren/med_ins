    <h3>Aaron Lindgren's Codecademy Medical Insurance Project</h3>
    
    This is going to be my site for the medical insurance project in <a href=https://www.codecademy.com target="_blank">codecademy</a>.  My plan is to have a bunch of graphs with an explanatory header above each one.
    <br>
    <br>
    Some ideas that I have:
    <ul>
        <li>A graph showing cost going up with age, with average BMI, all nonsmokers</li>
        <li>Male/female cost</li>
        <li>One showing cost going up with BMI</li>
        <li>I'm sure I'll have other ideas as we go through this.</li>
    </ul>
